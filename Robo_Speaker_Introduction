# Robo Speaker 0.1

Welcome to Robo Speaker 0.1, a simple and fun Python-based text-to-speech (TTS) application that uses your system's speaker to vocalize any text input through the command line interface (CLI). This project was created by Mahi.

## Project Overview

Robo Speaker 0.1 is a mini project designed to demonstrate basic text-to-speech capabilities using Python. The application listens for user input in the CLI and converts the text into speech, utilizing the system's built-in speaker. It is a straightforward implementation that showcases how to leverage system libraries for speech synthesis.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Input any text via the CLI, and Robo Speaker will pronounce it out loud.
- **Easy Exit**: Type 'q' to exit the application gracefully, with a farewell message.

## How It Works

The project uses PowerShell commands to access the Windows Speech API (System.Speech) for speech synthesis. When the user inputs text, the program constructs a command to be executed by PowerShell, which then performs the text-to-speech conversion.

### Code Explanation

Here's a brief overview of the code:

```python
import os

if __name__=='__main__':
    print("Welcome to Robo Speaker 0.1 created by Mahi!")
    print("Note: Type 'q' to exit - ")

    # Initial greeting
    command = f'powershell -Command "Add-Type –AssemblyName System.speech; (New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer).Speak(\'{"Welcome to Robo Speaker"}\')"'
    os.system(command)
    
    while True:
        x = input("Enter what you want me to pronounce: ")
        if x == 'q':
            # Farewell message
            command = f'powershell -Command "Add-Type –AssemblyName System.speech; (New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer).Speak(\'{"Good Bye! Have a nice day."}\')"'
            os.system(command)
            break
        
        # Constructing the PowerShell command to speak the input text
        command = f'powershell -Command "Add-Type –AssemblyName System.speech; (New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer).Speak(\'{x}\')"'
        os.system(command)


### Notes for Mac Users

If you are using a macOS, you can replace the PowerShell commands with the `say` command:

```python
# For macOS
command = f"say {x}"


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robo-speaker.git
    cd robo-speaker
    

2. Run the Python script:
   
    python robo_speaker.py
    

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input text and hear it spoken aloud.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows OS with PowerShell (for the provided script)
- Optional: macOS for alternative command (`say`)
